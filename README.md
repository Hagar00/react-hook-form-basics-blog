This repository provides a comprehensive guide to using React Hook Form for handling form validation in React. Learn the fundamentals of useForm, field validation, integration with third-party components using Controller, and managing dynamic fields with useFieldArray, complete with examples and best practices.
# Basics of React Hook Form

## Introduction
React Hook Form is a lightweight library for handling form validation in React. Unlike other form libraries, it uses uncontrolled inputs (using `ref`) instead of relying on React state to control the inputs. This approach reduces the number of re-renders and makes the form more performant. Additionally, React Hook Form is minimal with zero dependencies, making it a great choice for modern web applications.

## Benefits of Using React Hook Form
1. **Uncontrolled Inputs with Ref**: This makes the forms more performant by reducing the number of re-renders.
2. **Small Size and Zero Dependencies**: It’s a lightweight library, meaning it won’t bloat your project.

## Fundamentals of the `useForm` Hook
The `useForm` Hook returns an object containing a few key properties, such as `register` and `handleSubmit`. These properties are crucial for integrating forms with React Hook Form.

```jsx
const { register, handleSubmit } = useForm();
